  %p.description
    Non-Rewarded Installs allow you to buy installations of your application through our banner ad network. Like Pay-Per-Install, you only pay when a user installs and runs your application.  The difference is that with Non-Rewarded Installs, users do not receive any virtual currency reward in exchange for downloading your app.

    Featured Installs let you buy premium views for your app offer, such as being displayed full-screen when an app is launched. Like Pay-Per-Install, you only pay when a user installs your app.
