%h3 Create an associated offer based on #{@offer.name_with_suffix}

%p This will create a copy of the #{@offer.name_with_suffix} offer, except it will not be Tapjoy Enabled.

%p Once you've created the offer, you can edit it independently of the main offer.

%p Associated offers will only show up in publisher apps that have integrated version 4.0 or greater of our sdk.
