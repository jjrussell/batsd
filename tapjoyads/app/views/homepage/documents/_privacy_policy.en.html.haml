If you opt to use such a service, by proceeding, you are allowing Tapjoy to access certain of your information maintained by the SNS, and you are agreeing to the Terms of Use provided by that SNS.  By way of example, and depending on the privacy settings you have chosen at a given SNS, you might interact with friends who are also members of that SNS by automatically sharing your game reviews or other Tapjoy activity through the SNS (e.g., in the case of Facebook, by choosing to have your Tapjoy reviews automatically posted on your Timeline or choosing to use Facepile to post the Facebook profile pictures of users who have connected with your page), or by keeping up on your friends’ Tapjoy activity through their own automatic SNS account postings (e.g., on their updates shown on your Facebook Newsfeed).

You have the option to disable Facebook Connect or similar SNS services at any time by logging into "My Profile" on your Tapjoy account and clicking on "Social Settings". You can also edit your privacy settings on the SNS itself (such as Facebook) to control the extent to which your activity on Tapjoy appears on Facebook, or to disconnect the Facebook Connect service, by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.
