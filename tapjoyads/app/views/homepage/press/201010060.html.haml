  Offerpal Media (#{link_to_offerpal}, announced today at the Game Developers
  Conference Online in Austin, Texas, that it has changed its name to Tapjoy,
  Inc. The new name better reflects the company's leadership in mobile application
  distribution and monetization in addition to its foundation as the largest
  provider of social and web-based virtual currency monetization.

%p
  &quot;Our new name embodies the stronger and more diverse company we've become
  over the last several quarters,&quot; said Tapjoy president and chief executive
  officer Mihir Shah. &quot;It builds on the strong market position we've
  established under the Offerpal and Tapjoy brands as the leader in alternative
  payments and virtual currency monetization on web and mobile respectively, while
  representing our more recent successes with mobile and web application
  distribution.&quot;

%p
  &quot;Tapjoy&quot; was originally the name of the mobile game developer and
  monetization company acquired by Offerpal Media in March. As part of Offerpal,
  Tapjoy quickly became the largest Pay-Per-Install distribution service for
  mobile applications on the iOS and Android platforms, capable of generating
  nearly 100,000 installs per day for a single application. Meanwhile, its
  turnkey virtual currency engine was the first fully-integrated payment solution
  enabling mobile developers to monetize virtual goods through advertising offers
  and alternative payments.

%p
  In July, Offerpal launched its SocialKast suite of products to provide Web
  developers with new user acquisition and re-engagement services across multiple
  social channels and major media platforms. SocialKast's Viral APIs allow
  developers to send notifications and other messages directly into the platforms'
  activity streams, email inboxes, chat windows and other key touchpoints.
  SocialKast also features a cross-app Promo Bar, which lets developers promote
  their applications on a handpicked list of relevant partner apps.

%p
  The rename of the combined entities as Tapjoy represents the completed
  integration of Offerpal Media and Tapjoy as a single organization. All product,
  sales, engineering and other functions now operate under a unified brand.

%p
  Tapjoy also announced it is moving its headquarters to San Francisco. It will
  continue to operate its offices in Fremont, New York, London and Tokyo. More
