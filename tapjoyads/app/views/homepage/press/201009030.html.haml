  Offerpal Media, the leader in social gaming monetization and distribution
  services, announced today that Mihir Shah has been named president and chief
  executive officer, while chairman and former CEO George Garrick has been named
  executive chairman.

%p
  &quot;I am honored to lead Offerpal during this exciting time,&quot; said Shah.
  &quot;The social and mobile gaming spaces are in a transitional and converging
  period right now, and we have some exciting ideas for using our extensive
  footprint and expertise to help game developers, social platforms and online
  advertisers navigate the changing environment. I look forward to working with
  the entire Offerpal and Tapjoy teams as we continue to find innovative ways to
  meet our customers' evolving needs.&quot;

  Shah was hired by Garrick in December 2009 as the company's chief revenue
  officer, bringing with him more than 17 years of experience growing Internet and
  technology companies from the ground up. In his previous role, Shah was
  responsible for overseeing all of Offerpal's commercial activities, including
  revenue growth and user acquisition. His efforts have been integral in helping
  the company break into new verticals and forge strategic partnerships with key
  publishers and platforms.

%p
  &quot;Our industry and company are going through some exciting transitions, and
  the evolving industry has created new opportunities for developers and new
  emerging gaming environments that we believe the firm is well-positioned to
  address, especially with our unique web/mobile capabilities&quot; said Garrick.
  &quot;As we modify our product strategy and direction accordingly, I can think
  of nobody better to lead this effort, and it's important that Mihir have
  complete operating control over all of the company's resources. I look forward
  to continuing to serve the company and working closely with Mihir in the role of
  executive chairman.&quot;

  Prior to joining Offerpal Media, Shah was vice president of ad networks for
  RockYou, a leading provider of applications and widgets in the social media
  space. In a short time, Shah grew the company's revenues by more than 500
  percent and more than quadrupled gross margin. He previously served as vice
  president and worldwide general manager of direct selling services at QuinStreet
  (NasdaqGS: QNST), the worldwide leader in performance-based lead generation.
  Shah received his BA in Quantitative Economics from Stanford University.
