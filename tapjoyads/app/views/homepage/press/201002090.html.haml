  Offerpal Media (#{link_to_offerpal}), a leader in virtual currency payment
  alternatives, today announced &quot;Offerpal Tasks,&quot; a new way for
  consumers to earn virtual currency for use in their favorite online games and
  social networks by completing simple online tasks through Amazon Mechanical
  Turk. Sample tasks include rating search results, categorizing web sites or
  articles, and answering questions. Offerpal Tasks are now available throughout
  Offerpal's network of more than 2,000 web sites and applications.

  The new service will allow online gamers to select from thousands of 'Human
  Intelligence Tasks,' work whenever it's convenient, and convert their earnings
  into virtual currency that can be spent in online games and virtual worlds.
  &quot;We're pleased that Offerpal has chosen to leverage Amazon Mechanical
  Turk for their 'Tasks' service,&quot; said Steve Rabuchin, General Manager
  for Amazon Web Services.

  Offerpal Tasks are accessible as a tab within the Offerpal I-Frame, alongside
  several other options for earning virtual currency, such as completing targeted
  advertising offers, filling out online surveys, and shopping at brand name
  retailers. The user browses through the Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace and
  selects a task based on the type of work, how long it is estimated to take, and
  how much it pays. Payment is made after the user completes the work and it is
  approved by the requester.

  Other types of tasks that are regularly available through Amazon Mechanical Turk include:

  %li Data cleansing
  %li Transcription
  %li Proofreading web content
  %li Tagging photos
  %li Moderating User Generated Content
  %li Editing content

%p
  &quot;The beauty of earning virtual currency through Amazon Mechanical Turk is
  that it's very simple work that can be done anywhere at any time, and the
  payments can add up quickly,&quot; said George Garrick, CEO of Offerpal Media.
  &quot;We're proud to leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to bring social gamers yet
  another alternative payment method to go along with offers, surveys, shopping,
  videos and all our other options, while providing developers with another way
  to monetize larger portions of their audience.&quot;

%p
  Amazon Mechanical Turk has a feedback loop that rates the quality of the work
  being done. For more information, visit http://www.offerpalmedia.com/developers.php.
