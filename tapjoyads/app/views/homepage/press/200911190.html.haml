  Offerpal Media, the leader in virtual currency monetization, today published a
  set of advertising policies on its web site and unveiled details on its efforts
  to create a better user experience for consumers who complete advertising offers
  in exchange for virtual currency on popular online games and social networks.
  The new advertising policies forbid any offers that are misleading, deceptive or
  otherwise objectionable, while defining clear guidelines and principles for the
  language and creative of all offers distributed through the Offerpal platform.
%p
  &quot;The direct marketing industry, in all channels, is plagued by unscrupulous
  marketers, but the rapid growth and popularity of virtual currency offers has
  spotlighted the problem in social media,&quot; said George Garrick, CEO of
  Offerpal Media. &quot;As the leader in the space, Offerpal is in the fortunate
  position of having more resources than any of our competitors, and we are
  investing these resources to build out technologies and compliance systems to
  help take the industry to the highest possible standard of quality and integrity.&quot;

%p
  While the new policies serve as a minimum standard for compliance, Offerpal's
  platform offers publishing partners the flexibility to custom define their
  environments based on their specific needs and compliance requirements.
  Offerpal will rate all offers by quality and allow its partners to select a
  quality level of compliance ranging from &quot;Level 1&quot; for minimal
  restrictions to &quot;Level 5&quot; for highly conservative restrictions.

%p
  Other efforts the company is taking to elevate the standards for the industry include:
  %ul
    %li Creating a &quot;Compliance Server,&quot; which will serve as a 24x7 electronic watchdog to look for any unapproved deviations to an advertiser's landing pages in order to ensure that any violations are caught and removed within five minutes;
    %li Upgrading our Customer Support facilities by adding more representatives and better tools to ensure that every ticket is processed within 48 hours;
    %li Partnering with well-known industry associations and other offer provider platforms to jointly form standards boards and committees that will establish industry-wide standards and regulations;
    %li Refining the company's multi-step review and approval process to ensure that every offer it distributes is in complete compliance with the developers and publishers through whom the offer is distributed;
    %li Securing new &quot;high-value&quot; offers with compelling discounts, coupons or custom deals from select advertisers with recognizable brand names.
