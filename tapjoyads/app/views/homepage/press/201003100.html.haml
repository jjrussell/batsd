  While most game developers struggle to monetize even three percent of their
  users through direct payments for virtual currency, new numbers released today
  by Offerpal Media (#{link_to_offerpal}) at the Game Developers Conference show
  that alternative payment methods enable developers to monetize significantly
  larger portions of their user base. Derived from a study conducted by comScore,
  a leader in measuring the digital world, as well as from Offerpal's own
  network-wide monetization performance, the numbers verify that social gamers are
  enthusiastic about alternative, or indirect, payment methods as a way to earn
  virtual currency for free rather than having to pay for it directly.

%p
  According to the comScore study, 53.3% of the total respondents reported that
  they would be &quot;very likely&quot; to complete a marketing action such as
  filling out a survey, watching a video, shopping at online retailers or signing
  up for a subscription in order to get points for the games they play on leading
  social networks. By comparison, only 22.8% of the respondents reported that they
  would be willing and are able to buy the points using cash payment methods such
  as credit cards, PayPal, bank transfers or mobile billing.

%p
  The study found that 29.7% of social gamers do not have the ability or the means
  to pay for virtual currency with cash options, and even among those who do have
  the ability and the means, 34.9% say they are &quot;very unlikely&quot; to part
  with their money in order to purchase points. When asked to indicate how likely
  they would be to use indirect payment methods to earn points in the games they
  play, the top preferred marketing actions included, in order, completing a free
  survey, watching a video, completing tasks such as tagging a photo or
  proofreading a document, shopping for clothes or other goods online, subscribing
  to a magazine and subscribing to a movie rental program.

%p
  Consumers' preference for alternative means to pay for virtual currency has been
  borne out in Offerpal's own metrics as well.&nbsp; In recent months, the company
  has added to its monetization platform a number of alternative payment options,
  including surveys, shopping rewards, tasks and video, to go along with the
  offers it has always run. Offerpal reports that since September, 2009-when it
  launched Offerpal SURVEYS, the first of these incremental alternative payment
  options-the company has seen a 20% increase in the percent of users it is able
  to monetize.

%p
  One example of this growth is seen in recent tests of the company's video
  campaigns, in which 75% of the consumers who viewed a video ad in exchange for
  virtual currency had never before completed any type of offer nor made a direct
  payment. What's more, nearly 10% of those users went on to complete at least one
  or more transactions-often incremental cash purchases-in just the first week
  after watching a video. Similarly, of the users whose first &quot;payment&quot;
  of virtual currency was by earning it through Offerpal's shopping rewards
  program, 21% went on to make a second transaction through the Offerpal system
  within one week.&nbsp;

%p
  &quot;The data we're seeing shows that there is clearly a strong demand within
  social gaming for alternative ways to pay for virtual currency,&quot; said
  George Garrick, CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;When you think of how easy it is
  to conduct some of these marketing actions like watching a video ad, and the
  fact that so many people are already doing them online frequently and for no
  compensation, it makes complete sense that they might as well get rewarded in
  virtual currency for it. Our goal is to leverage all the most popular alt-pay
  methods to monetize the maximum number of users at the highest Revenue Per User
  for our developer partners.&quot;

%p
  Other findings from the report include:
  %ul
    %li Gamers in the 25-34 age range are most likely (70.9 % &quot;very likely&quot;) to be willing to earn virtual currency through marketing actions;
    %li Most of the gamers (54.5%) report playing games online at least once a day; 26.7% reported playing several times a week; 11.5% play about once a week; and 7.3% play two to three times a month;
    %li When asked what kinds of games they play on a regular basis, 58.4% of the respondents said they regularly play virtual world/simulation games, followed by arcade games (40.3%), role playing games (33.5%), action games (29.7%), board games (26.9%), card games (25.6%) and word games (23.4%);
    %li Of those who say they are &quot;very likely&quot; to buy points with a cash payment method, a majority of the users are men (53.4%) and a plurality in the 25-34 age range (42.8%); 85.4% of the users who say they are &quot;very likely&quot; to buy points with cash are also &quot;very likely&quot; to earn points through marketing actions.&nbsp;

  George Garrick will share findings from the release during Offerpal's hosted
  forum at the Game Developers Conference called &quot;Social and Mobile Gaming:
  What's Next?&quot;, to be held Friday, March 12th, 2010, at 3:00 pm in Moscone

  The study was conducted between February 12th and February 15th, 2010, and
  includes detailed responses from 799 comScore panelists. Respondents were
  filtered to only include users who play games on the leading social network at
  least once a month.
