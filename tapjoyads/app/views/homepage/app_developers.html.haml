        The Tapjoy Offerwall is a list of marketing actions that your users can complete and earn virtual currency. The action might be
        %b
          "Install Kayak Mobile"
        or even&nbsp;
        %b><
          "Install Tap Defense and beat level 3"
        \.
      %p  
        By integrating this ad unit, you can double your app's revenue by monetizing all of your users who can't participate in in-app payments or aren't willing to pay money. Since many offers are free, there is no payment information necessary in order to monetize these users.
      %p
        The Offerwall allows you to unlock these additional revenue streams without affecting existing payments.
