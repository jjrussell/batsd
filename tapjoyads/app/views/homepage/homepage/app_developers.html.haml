        The Tapjoy Marketplace is a list of marketing actions that your users
        can complete to access premium content. The action might be
        %b &quot;Sign up for Netflix&quot;
        or even
        = succeed('.') do
          %b &quot;Complete this tutorial for Tap Defense&quot;
      %p
        By integrating this ad unit, you can double your app's revenue by
        monetizing all of your users who can't participate in in-app payments
        or aren't willing to pay money. Since many offers are free, there is
        no payment information necessary in order to monetize these users.
      %p
        The Marketplace allows you to unlock these additional revenue streams
        without affecting existing payments.
