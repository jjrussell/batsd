YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND THE COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

These Terms and Conditions, the applicable Insertion Order and the applicable selections made by Client in its initial or ongoing online configuration of its Tapjoy account (<b>&quot;Configuration&quot;</b>) shall be collectively referred to as the <b>&quot;Agreement.&quot;</b>
    %h2 1.	Grant of License

    %h2 2.	Advertisement Specifications; Implementation
    %p Client agrees to deliver the Advertisements and implement conversion tracking, both in accordance with the technical specifications provided by Tapjoy to enable proper display of such Advertisements and tracking the results thereof in connection with the Tapjoy advertising service(s) selected through Configuration (&quot;Tapjoy Services&quot;).

Unless Tapjoy approves specifically in writing, Client may only use the Tapjoy Services (including any SDK) as provided by Tapjoy, without modification.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Client shall not to seek or set up a direct linking or other arrangement whereby the Tapjoy Service or parts thereof is circumvented and Tapjoy is unable to fully track and monitor the conversions and other events that are the basis for determining payments owing to Tapjoy. Client may not otherwise interfere with or manipulate in any way Tapjoy's tracking and payment calculation processes or the Tapjoy Service generally.

    %h2 4.	Restrictions
    %p Client acknowledges that Tapjoy does not provide the Tapjoy Services for Advertisements by any entities that run, provide, enable or promote, for themselves or for others, services similar to any Tapjoy services.  Client represents, covenants and warrants that it is not and shall not be such an entity during the term of this Agreement.
    %h2 5.	Terms of Payment
    %p Client is responsible for payment to Tapjoy for all conversions generated by each advertising campaign using the Tapjoy Services whether or not Client has properly reported such transactions to Tapjoy.

To the extent that Client makes a pre-payment for any advertising campaign, such pre-paid account balances are non-refundable and will be reduced to offset fees as they are incurred. All prices are in United States dollars and do not include taxes that may be assessed by any jurisdiction which shall be Client's responsibility. If withholding taxes or any other taxes are imposed by any jurisdiction on the transactions pursuant to this Agreement, Client will pay such taxes to ensure that Tapjoy receives the full amount invoiced to Client without offset or deduction. Client will promptly furnish to Tapjoy the applicable receipts and/or certificates regarding such remittances as soon as reasonably practicable.

If any provision contained in this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the original intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.
