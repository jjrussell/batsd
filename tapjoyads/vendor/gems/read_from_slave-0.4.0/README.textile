h1. Read_from_slave

h4. Read_from_slave for Rails enables database reads from a slave database, while writes continue to go to the master

Read_from_slave will work with Rails 2.2 and above, including Rails 3 versions.

h2. Installation

<pre>
<code>
gem install read_from_slave
</code>
</pre>

h2. Configuration

In config/environments/production.rb (for instance)

<pre>
<code>
config.gem "read_from_slave"
</code>
</pre>

In config/database.yml

<pre>
<code>
production:
  adapter: mysql
  database: mydatabase
  username: myuser
  password: mypassword
  host: my.main.database.server.com
  port: 3306

slave_for_mydatabase:
  adapter: mysql
  database: mydatabase
  username: myuser
  password: mypassword
  socket: /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
</code>
</pre>

Just use the regular YAML format to specify your slave database, it could equally well be on
another server as the local example given above.

h2. Phusion Passenger

Note that if you are using Passenger, you need to make sure that the slave database is reconnected
if there is any chance that it was accessed before the spawner forks.  This could be because
database was accessed during the generation of routes, or perhaps if you are using the has_many_polymorphs
gem.

The safest thing to do is to have something like this in your production.rb or environment.rb:

<pre>
<code>
PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
  if forked
    # We're in smart spawning mode.                                                               
    ActiveRecord::Base.establish_slave_connections
  else
    # We're in conservative spawning mode. We don't need to do anything.                          
  end
end
</code>
</pre>

h2. Tests

Clone the git repository, and you can run the read_from_slave tests or entire ActiveRecord test suite to prove that read_from_slave works correctly.

<pre>
<code>
$ rake test
...snip..
Finished in 0.046365 seconds.

7 tests, 7 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

$ rake test_with_active_record
...snip...
Finished in 51.904306 seconds.

</code>
</pre>

h2. Todo

* Support a pool of multiple slaves

h2. References

* "Masochism":http://github.com/technoweenie/masochism/tree/master
** not thread safe
** won't work with apps that talk to multiple (master) databases
* "Acts as readonlyable":http://rubyforge.org/projects/acts-as-with-ro/
** old, not suitable for Rails 2.x
* "master_slave_adapter":http://github.com/mauricio/master_slave_adapter/tree/master
** similar to read_from_slave, but adapter based approach
* "multi_db":http://github.com/schoefmax/multi_db/tree/master
** another one, proxy connection approach
** looks like it won't work with apps that talk to multiple (master) databases
** more complex than read_from_slave
