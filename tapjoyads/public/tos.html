    <h2>15. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>“<b>Confidential Information</b>” of Tapjoy shall mean (a) the Advertisements, prior to publication and (b) any data (including any usage data and compilations thereof), information or software relating to or collected through the Tapjoy Services (except for the User Data); “<b>Confidential Information</b>” of Publisher shall mean the User Data; and “<b>Confidential Information</b>” of either party shall mean (a) the existence and content of this Agreement and (b) any other information designated in writing, or identified orally at time of disclosure, by the disclosing party as “confidential” or “proprietary.” Each party will keep confidential, and neither party will use for any purpose, or disclose to any third party, any Confidential Information of the other party except to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement.

The foregoing restriction does not apply to information that: (a) has been independently developed by the receiving party without access to the other party’s Confidential Information; (b) has become publicly known through no breach of this Section 15 by the receiving party; (c) has been rightfully received from a third party authorized to make such disclosure; (d) has been approved for release in writing by the disclosing party; or (e) is required to be disclosed by a competent legal or governmental authority, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt written notice of such requirement prior to disclosure and assists in obtaining an order to protect the information from public disclosure.</p>
    <h2>16. Termination</h2>

Publisher may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or for no reason upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to Tapjoy.  In addition, in the event of a material breach by one party, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement immediately without prior notice or cure period.  In the event of any termination, both parties will remain liable for any amounts owed to the other party prior to the date of termination and such obligation to pay shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Sections 1, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 and 18 shall also survive.</p>
    <h2>17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.  Any dispute hereunder will be negotiated in good faith between the parties within forty-five (45) days commencing upon written notice from one party to the other and neither party will file an action prior to the termination of such forty-five (45) day period. Publisher agrees that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Alameda County, California, and Publisher hereby consents and submits to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tapjoy may seek immediate injunctive relief in any court having jurisdiction in the event of breach or threatened breach by Publisher of Sections 14 or 15.</p>
    <h2>18. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>The words “include” and “including” and variations thereof will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by Publisher, but may be assigned by Tapjoy to an entity that succeeds to all or substantially all of Tapjoy’s business or assets.  Tapjoy and Publisher are independent contractors, and neither Tapjoy nor Publisher is an agent, representative or partner of the other.  This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between Tapjoy and Publisher, and supersedes any and all prior agreements (whether written or oral) with respect to the subject matter specified through the Configuration.  The waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default, and will not act to amend or negate the rights of the waiving party. If any provision contained in this Agreement is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law, then such provision will be severed and replaced with a new provision that most closely reflects the original intention of the parties, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>
