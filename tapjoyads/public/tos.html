    <p>The Web pages available at www.Tapjoy.com, and all linked pages unless indicated otherwise ("Site"), are owned and operated by Company, and are accessed by you ("User") under the following terms and conditions: ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Company may offer to provide certain services that relate to facilitating the purchase and sale of mobile advertisements by bringing together mobile advertisers and publishers, as described more fully on the Site, and which are selected by User through the process provided on the Site ("Services").

Company reserves the right, at its discretion, to refuse to allow access to the Services to any User at any time.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO USER.</p>
    <h2>FEES AND PAYMENT</h2>
    <p>Some of the Services require payment of fees. Company reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon prior notice to User, which may be sent by email or posted on the Site. If User is an advertiser, User shall pre-pay all applicable fees, as described on the Site, in connection with such Services selected by User. If User is a publisher, User shall receive a percentage of the Net Revenue of Advertisements associated with User's use of the Services as solely determined by Company. "Net Revenue" shall mean revenues actually received by Company from the sale, use or other disposition of advertisements displayed on User's Mobile Property less sales, use and excise taxes, less any allowances actually made or taken for returns, cash discounts and promotional allowances. The portion of Net Revenue received by User shall be determined on the first Monday of each calendar month, on which day those revenues accrued to User's account thirty (30) or more days earlier shall become eligible to be paid. Payments to User shall be sent by Company only if User's earned balance is greater than or equal to $20USD (Twenty Dollars, US). If User's earned balance is less than $20USD, no check shall be sent until the following calendar month, on the first Monday of which Company shall make the aforesaid determination anew. In addition, if User is a publisher, User agrees that any payments that may become due to User (as described on the Site) are specifically conditioned upon Company's receipt of full payment from the applicable advertiser. If Company does not receive the applicable payment in full from any such advertiser, Company shall have no liability or responsibility to User (and User hereby releases Company) with respect thereto. If User disputes any payment made in connection with the Services, User must notify Company in writing within thirty (30) days of any such payment. Failure to so notify Company shall result in the waiver by User of any claims related to such disputed payment. Payment shall be calculated solely based on records maintained by Company. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by Company or have any effect under this Agreement. Company shall not be liable for any payment based on (i) any fraudulent impressions generated by any person, robot, automated program or similar device or for fraudulent impressions similarly generated on any advertisements, as reasonably determined by Company; (ii) impressions commingled with a significant number of fraudulent impressions or fraudulent clicks described in (i) above; or (iii) any breach of this Agreement by User. To ensure proper payment, User is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with User's account and Company User ID. User agrees to pay all applicable taxes or charges imposed by any government entity in connection with User's use of the Services.</p>
    <h2>OTHER POLICIES</h2>
    <p>In the course of using the Site or Services, User may be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information to Company (such information referred to hereinafter as "User Information"). Company's information collection and use policies with respect to such User Information are set forth in the Sites Privacy Policy which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. User acknowledges and agrees that User is solely responsible for the accuracy and content of its User Information. Company cannot and does not guarantee the security of any of the User Information that a User transmits online.</p>
    <p>Users who believe that material or Content residing on or accessible through the Site or Services infringes a copyright should review the Sites Copyright Dispute Policy.</p>
    <h2>TERMINATION.</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate the Services at any time by notifying the other party by any means. Company may also terminate or suspend any and all Services and access to the Site immediately, without prior notice or liability, if User breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable and non-cancelable. Upon termination of the User's account, User's right to use the Services will immediately cease and User will remove all Company code from User's Mobile Properties. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>
    <h2>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</h2>
    <p>If User is a publisher, User represents and warrants to Company that (i) User is the owner of each Mobile Property User designates in connection with the use of Services or that User is legally authorized to act on behalf of the owner of such Mobile Property for the purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) User has all necessary right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the acts required of User hereunder. User further represents and warrants to Company that each of User's Mobile Properties and any material displayed therein: (a) comply with all applicable laws, statutes, ordinances and regulations; (b) do not breach and have not breached any duty toward or rights of any person or entity including, without limitation, rights of intellectual property, publicity or privacy, or rights or duties under consumer protection, product liability, tort, or contract theories; and (c) are not hate-related in content.  If User is an advertiser, User represents and warrants to Company that (i) User is the owner of each Advertisement User designates in connection with the use of Services or that User is legally authorized to act on behalf of the owner of such Advertisement for the purposes of this Agreement, and (ii) User has all necessary right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform the acts required of User hereunder.

    <h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>
    <p>The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company's reasonable control. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by User except with Company's prior written consent. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. Both parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and User does not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever.</p>
