                    <i>April 30</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    <i>Legends of Zork&trade; Publisher Deploys Offerpal Media's "Managed Offer Platform" to Monetize Virtual Currency</i>
                    <br /><br />
                   <strong>Fremont, CA - April 30, 2009-</strong> <a href="http://www.offerpalmedia.com/">Offerpal Media</a>,the leading monetization platform for social networks, applications, online games and virtual worlds, today announced a partnership with
               <a href="http://www.joltonline.com/">Jolt Online Gaming</a>, one of the leading browser games publishers in the world, to monetize the virtual currency inside Jolt's latest game, <a href="http://legendsofzork.com/">Legends of Zork</a>&trade;.<br />
                    <br />
                   Founded in 2008,Jolt Online Gaming's popular titles include
    <a href="http://www.trukz.com/">Trukz.com</a>, <a href="http://www.utopiakingdoms.com/">UtopiaKingdoms.com</a>, the cult favorite <a href="http://swirve.com/">Swirve.com</a> and, most recently,  <a href="http://legendsofzork.com/">Legends of Zork</a>&trade; an updated version of the much-loved classic adventure game from the 1970s. Jolt Online Gaming selected Offerpal Media's &quot;<a href="http://www.offerpal.com/platform.php">Managed Offer Platform</a>&quot; to enable Legends of Zork players to earn the game's <a href="http://www.offerpal.com/publishers.php">virtual currency</a> &quot;Coconuts,&quot; for free by taking part in demographically and behaviorally targeted consumer advertising offers such as free trials,big-brand discounts,online surveys and more. &quot;Coconuts&quot; can be used to purchase &quot;Perks,&quot; which give the players certain in-game advantages such as &quot;Action Points,&quot; &quot;Trap Avoidance Spells,&quot; and various other items. <br />
                    <br />
                   &quot;The Offerpal Media platform checked all the boxes for us,&quot; said Dylan Collins, CEO of Jolt Online Gaming. &quot;Their advertising offers provide the perfect middle ground for users who aren't yet willing to spend real dollars on their favorite games, but are deeply engaged and want to earn virtual currency. The beauty of Offerpal's solution is that users are rewarded for their efforts and become more deeply engaged with the game.&quot;<br />
                <br />


					Offerpal Media has already helped hundreds of its publishing partners earn eCPM rates in the hundreds of dollars as the monetization solution of choice on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/index.php?lh=26e62db1d856724127fadb54d426ab40&amp;">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://www.bebo.com/c/site/index">Bebo</a>, <a href="http://hi5.com/">hi5</a> and dozens of other social Web sites such as <a href="http://www.weeworld.com/">WeeWorld</a>, <a href="http://www.smallworlds.com/login.php?login=true">SmallWorlds</a>, <a href="http://www.aeriagames.com/">Aeria Games</a>, <a href="http://www.outspark.com/">Outspark</a> and also on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple iPhone</a>.Unlike traditional online advertisements, Offerpal's targeted, <a href="http://www.offerpal.com/advertisers.php">non-intrusive offers</a> are an embedded part of the gaming experience, engaging with consumers rather than distracting them. The virtual currency-based program keeps users coming back to the publisher's property again and again, thus enhancing the game experience and increasing its stickiness. <br />
					<br />




                    &quot;Legends of Zork has a dedicated following of both original fans from the game's 70s incarnation and a new audience of online-gamers, and virtual currency is a vital element to the user's experience,&quot; said Anu Shukla, CEO and Founder of Offerpal Media. &quot;Integrating Offerpal's platform with Zork's&trade; virtual currency not only provides a way for users to earn &quot;coconuts&quot; for free, but it generates a significant and reliable incremental revenue stream for Jolt Gaming.&quot;
