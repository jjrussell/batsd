					    <h1>Offerpal Media CEO Anu Shukla to Address User Engagement and Monetization at SNAP Summit</h1>
                    <br />
                    <i>October 27th</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    <i>Social advertising expert to provide insight on monetizing and engaging social Web users at one-day business event</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>SAN FRANCISCO - October 27, 2008 - </strong>Offerpal Media CEO Anu Shukla will speak at tomorrow's SNAP Summit, San Francisco's premier conference on user experience and engagement for the social Web. Her session will address the key issues facing social publishers who seek to understand best practices on growing their traffic, engaging their users and monetizing their properties. Shukla's session, "Incentivize and Monetize Social Traffic with Virtual Currency," is scheduled for 12:00 p.m. on the main stage of the Parc 55 Hotel.
                    <br /><br />
                    Shukla is the founder of Offerpal Media, providers of the first advertising platform that helps publishers monetize social traffic while allowing advertisers to target interested consumers on Facebook, MySpace, Bebo, hi5 and other social networks. Prior to leading Offerpal, Shukla founded two successful companies in the personalization-marketing arena, Mybuys Inc. and Rubric, Inc.
                    <br /><br />
                    The SNAP Summit, a full-day conference focusing on the business and design of social applications, is expected to draw industry leaders in the emerging and hot social networking space.
                    <br /><br />
                    During her session, Shukla will get to the heart of the most pressing questions facing social application developers and other social publishers. While it's no longer a secret that the most effective way to monetize a social application is to leverage virtual currency, for many this is still a new and confusing prospect. Shukla will impart best practices for developers seeking to drive and monetize social traffic.
                    <br /><br />
                    "This is a rapidly growing market, with unparalleled opportunities for developers to grow their businesses, engage their users, increase their installs, and generate a strong revenue stream. Our platform helps developers achieve these results," said Shukla.
                    <br /><br />
                    As part of the presentation, Shukla will showcase the Offerpal Media business model and the company's innovative turn-key, full-service "Managed Offer Platform," which presents uniquely engineered offers and customized offer displays on social application and ecommerce sites. Offerpal also provides its application partners with 24/7 customer support, real-time reporting, custom account management and more.
                    <br /><br />
                    A workshop at 1:30 p.m. will follow the presentation, taking a deeper dive into the role of virtual currency in driving real world revenues by looking at case studies from three popular applications, Friends For Sale!, Make a Baby, and PuzzleBee. The panel will explore the types of virtual goods or services sold on their applications and the fundamental principles accelerating their virtual economies forward.
                    <br /><br />
