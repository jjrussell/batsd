                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, Calif.   </strong>-<strong> November 4, 2009    </strong> - Offerpal Media, the leader in virtual currency monetization for online games, virtual worlds and social networks, announced today that George Garrick has been named chief executive officer.
                <p>Garrick brings more than 25 years of experience in technology, advertising and consumer businesses to Offerpal Media. His track record of accelerating revenue growth and brokering strategic relationships with customers and partners will be critical assets in leading Offerpal Media.</p>
                <p>&quot;I am extremely excited about the opportunity to lead Offerpal Media going forward,&quot; said Garrick.  &quot;The social gaming and virtual goods space is an exciting and exploding industry and Offerpal is centrally positioned as the leading payments and offers platform supporting content developers, publishers, marketers, and of course, consumers.  We have a great team of people and I am looking forward to working with them in defining where we go from here and in taking Offerpal to the next level.&quot; </p>
                <p>Garrick was  part of the management team that took Information Resources, Inc. from $2  million to $300 million in revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Garrick served in London as President-IRI Europe,  launching IRI services in France,  Germany,  Italy,  Netherlands  and Turkey,  and later became CEO-North America.</p>
                <p>As CEO of  Flycast Communications, Garrick repositioned the startup into the Internet's  first major direct-response advertising network leading it to a $500 million  IPO and a subsequent sale for $2.3 billion. As Chairman and CEO of PlaceWare  Inc., Garrick guided the company to an acquisition by Microsoft for $200  million.&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently, Garrick has  served as CEO of Wine.com, Jingle Networks and Mochi Media.</p>
                <p>&quot;I have  known George for a long time,&quot; said Anu Shukla, Founder of Offerpal Media.&nbsp; &quot;After many months of searching, I believe  that George is the best CEO to scale the company to new heights. I am looking  forward to working with him closely.&quot;</p>
                <p>&quot;Offerpal  Media has done a tremendous job of pioneering and becoming the leader in the  virtual currency monetization space,&quot; said Doug Pepper, General Partner at  InterWest Partners.&nbsp; &quot;George's unique  executive capabilities, deep experience in the advertising industry, and track  record of building successful companies are exactly what Offerpal Media needs  at this stage.&quot;</p>
