					    <h1>Offerpal Media Launches Onboarding Application For MySpace Platform</h1>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Allows MySpace developers to start monetizing their applications in minutes</h2>
                    <br />
<b>Fremont, CA, September 3, 2008</b> ï¿½ Offerpal Media, the first "Managed Offer Platform" for applications on Facebook, MySpace, Bebo, hi5 and other social networks, today announced the launch of its MySpace native onboarding application to help application developers implement Offerpal's turnkey advertising solution quickly and seamlessly. Though the company already powers ad supported payments on such Top 20* MySpace apps as Own Your Friends!, Mobsters, Super Pets, Heroes, Speed Racing and others, the move now allows applications of any size or category to onboard and begin generating revenue in less than an hour. The application is available at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/offerpal" target="_blank">http://www.myspace.com/offerpal</a>.
<br /><br />
"There is a tremendous opportunity for application developers to continue to grow their businesses on the MySpace platform," said Kyle Brinkman, Vice President and General Manager, MySpace Developer Platform. "We're glad to see Offerpal launch an onboarding app that helps application developers engage their users, increase their installs, and generate a strong revenue stream."
<br /><br />
Offerpal Media's monetization platform has pioneered an innovative engagement-marketing model in which users can earn points, rewards or other types of virtual currency by participating in uniquely engineered offers such as free trials, surveys, big-brand discounts and more. The full-service platform appears in an I-frame within an application and comes complete with more than 1,000 advertising offers that are targeted to individual users based on behavioral patterns, relevance to the social graph, and Offerpal's proprietary targeting algorithms. Offerpal Media also provides its application partners with 24/7 customer support, real-time reporting, custom account management and more.
<br /><br />
"The MySpace platform is of great strategic importance to us, as it is to the entire application developer community, and we're committed to giving developers tools and guidance to generate more revenue from their MySpace apps," said Offerpal Media Founder and CEO, Anu Shukla. "Today's launch strengthens our position as the leading monetization platform on social networks."
<br /><br />
A variety of unique advertising formats and solutions are available for MySpace applications aside from the main Managed Offer I-Frame. For instance, developers can employ targeted banner ads within their application to encourage users to earn more points or virtual currencies by participating in relevant offers. Other formats include Reg-Path offers, Prestitial offers, a Shopping I-Frame and more. Offerpal Media also offers a powerful App Install program, allowing developers to grow their apps on a Cost-Per-Install, Cost-Per-Click or Free Click Exchange basis.
