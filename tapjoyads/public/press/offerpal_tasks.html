                <br />
        <em>February 9, 2010 </em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>Social gamers can now earn virtual currency by completing small, online tasks </i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, Calif.   </strong>-<strong> February 9, 2010    </strong> -                Offerpal Media,  (http://offerpalmedia.com),  a leader in virtual currency payment alternatives, today announced  &quot;Offerpal Tasks,&quot; a new way for consumers to earn virtual currency for use in their favorite online games and social networks by completing simple online tasks through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Sample tasks include rating search results, categorizing web sites or articles, and answering questions. Offerpal Tasks are now available throughout Offerpal's network of more than 2,000 web sites and applications.
                <p>The new service will allow online gamers to select from thousands of 'Human Intelligence Tasks,' work whenever it's convenient, and convert their earnings into virtual currency that can be spent in online games and virtual worlds. &quot;We're pleased that Offerpal has chosen to leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk for their 'Tasks' service,&quot; said Steve Rabuchin, General Manager for Amazon Web Services.  </p>
                <p>Offerpal Tasks are accessible as a tab within the Offerpal I-Frame, alongside several other options for earning virtual currency, such as completing targeted advertising offers, filling out online surveys, and shopping at brand name retailers. The user browses through the Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace and selects a task based on the type of work, how long it is estimated to take, and how much it pays. Payment is made after the user completes the work and it is approved by the requester. </p>
                <p>Other types of tasks that are regularly available through Amazon Mechanical Turk include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Data  cleansing</li>
                    <li>Transcription</li>
                    <li>Proofreading  web content </li>
                    <li>Tagging  photos</li>
                    <li>Moderating  User Generated Content</li>
                    <li>Editing  content </li>
                  </ul>
                  &quot;The beauty of earning virtual currency through Amazon Mechanical Turk is that it's very simple work that can be done anywhere at any time, and the payments can add up quickly,&quot; said George Garrick, CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;We're proud to leverage Amazon Mechanical Turk to bring social gamers yet another alternative payment method to go along with offers, surveys, shopping, videos and all our other options, while providing developers with another way to monetize larger portions of their audience.&quot;
                  <p>Amazon Mechanical  Turk has a feedback loop that rates the quality of the work being done.
