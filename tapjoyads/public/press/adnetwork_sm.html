					  <h1>Offerpal Media Launches Display Ad Network for Social Media </h1>
                <br />
        <em>April 20, 2010  </em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>New solution gives advertisers more reach into social media </i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>San Francisco    </strong>-<strong> April 20, 2010   </strong> -                Offerpal  Media (<a href="http://offerpalmedia.com">http://offerpalmedia.com</a>), the leader in monetization solutions for online games, virtual worlds and social networks, announced today the launch of a new display advertising network to enable brand and performance-based advertisers to reach their target audiences on social networks while monetizing a higher percentage of users for application developers and social publishers. Launched at the ad:tech digital marketing conference in San Francisco, the ad network features an array of IAB-standard ad units as well as rich-media opportunities to help advertisers connect with Offerpal's network of more than 225 million users.
                <p>&quot;The display ad network is a critical piece in allowing us to offer a one-stop-shop for social advertising and monetization,&quot; said George Garrick, Chairman and CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;Developers can now monetize their complete user experience with just one company, and advertisers can work with us to meet all of their marketing objectives from brand building and social reach to customer acquisition.&quot;</p>
                <p>The Offerpal network averages nearly 100 million unique visitors per month and spans more than 2,000 social web sites and applications. Advertisers of all sizes are able to reach this highly engaged social audience through a variety of IAB compliant ad units as well as rich media ad units and expandable ads. Additionally, Offerpal caters to both brand advertisers and performance marketers by providing an assortment of flexible pricing options, including CPM, CPC, CPA and a Cost per Install model for game developers looking to acquire new users.</p>
                <p>For game developers and social publishers, the addition of display advertising to Offerpal's current offers platform and alternative payment solutions enables them to monetize 100% of their traffic. The display network leverages Offerpal's advanced optimization engine to maximize publisher revenue, as well as the company's rigorous compliance processes to ensure all ads meet the advertising policies established by relevant social platforms and the company's own industry-leading quality standards. Publishers can take advantage of a self-serve onboarding interface to get up and running on the ad network within minutes, and they'll also benefit from Offerpal's global monetization, real-time analytics and bi-monthly payment terms. </p>
                <p>&quot;We are excited to have another monetization solution from a company we know and trust,&quot; said Erik Hedges of Tall Tree Games, whose game Fish World has more than 4 million monthly active users. &quot;Given all the consolidation among social ad networks recently, there is definitely room in the marketplace for new competition, especially from a company with the advertiser relationships and industry know-how that Offerpal has.&quot;</p>
