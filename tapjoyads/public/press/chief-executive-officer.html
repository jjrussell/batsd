					 <h1><strong>Offerpal Media Names Mihir Shah CEO; George Garrick Executive Chairman</strong></h1>
			      <p><br/>
		            <em>Social gaming industry veteran and company CRO will lead Offerpal's future growth</em><br /><br />
		            <strong>Fremont, CA - September 3, 2010  </strong> -
			    Offerpal Media, the leader in social gaming monetization and distribution services, announced today that Mihir Shah has been named president and chief executive officer, while chairman and former CEO George Garrick has been named executive chairman.
			    </p>
					<p>&quot;I am honored to lead Offerpal during this exciting time,&quot; said Shah. &quot;The social and mobile gaming spaces are in a transitional and converging period right now, and we have some exciting ideas for using our extensive footprint and expertise to help game developers, social platforms and online advertisers navigate the changing environment. I look forward to working with the entire Offerpal and Tapjoy teams as we continue to find innovative ways to meet our customers' evolving needs.&quot;</p>


					<p>Shah was hired by Garrick in December 2009 as the company's chief revenue officer, bringing with him more than 17 years of experience growing Internet and technology companies from the ground up. In his previous role, Shah was responsible for overseeing all of Offerpal's commercial activities, including revenue growth and user acquisition. His efforts have been integral in helping the company break into new verticals and forge strategic partnerships with key publishers and platforms.</p>

				<p>
				&quot;Our industry and company are going through some exciting transitions, and the evolving industry has created new opportunities for developers and new emerging gaming environments that we believe the firm is well-positioned to address, especially with our unique web/mobile capabilities&quot; said Garrick. &quot;As we modify our product strategy and direction accordingly, I can think of nobody better to lead this effort, and it's important that Mihir have complete operating control over all of the company's resources.  I look forward to continuing to serve the company and working closely with Mihir in the role of executive chairman.&quot;
				</p>

				<p>
					Prior to joining Offerpal Media, Shah was vice president of ad networks for RockYou, a leading provider of applications and widgets in the social media space. In a short time, Shah grew the company's revenues by more than 500 percent and more than quadrupled gross margin. He previously served as vice president and worldwide general manager of direct selling services at QuinStreet (NasdaqGS: QNST), the worldwide leader in performance-based lead generation. Shah received his BA in Quantitative Economics from Stanford University.
