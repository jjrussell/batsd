					 <h1>GamePoints.com Tops Half a Million Users in First Month </h1>
					<br/>
                    <i>Videos, surveys, shopping rewards among most popular alternative payment options  </i>
                    <br /><br />
					<strong>Fremont, CA </strong>&ndash;<strong> May 2010, 2010</strong> - Offerpal  Media (<a href="http://www.offerpalmedia.com">http://www.offerpalmedia.com</a>), the leader in virtual currency payment alternatives, announced today that its new consumer website, GamePoints.com (<a href="http://www.gamepoints.com">http://www.gamepoints.com</a>), has received more than 500,000 users since its beta launch less than a month ago, quickly making it the Web's largest rewards site specifically for online gamers. Live since May 4, 2010, the site enables consumers to earn virtual currency to use in their favorite social games and MMOs by taking part in targeted advertising offers and other types of marketing actions.

					<p>&quot;The early success of GamePoints.com signifies the strong demand and clear enthusiasm social gamers have for earning virtual currency through alternative payment options, as well as their willingness to do so outside of the gaming environment,&quot; said George Garrick, Chairman and CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;There is huge spending power being acquired by GamePoints.com members, and that translates into significant liquidity and a new, sustainable customer acquisition channel for our developer partners.&quot;</p>

					<p>To date, GamePoints.com's most popular methods for earning virtual currency, in order, have been watching videos, completing surveys, earning shopping rewards, taking part in ad offers, downloading music and subscribing to magazines. Other popular ways of earning free Game Points include trading in unwanted gift cards, purchasing movie tickets, recycling old electronics and more. </p>

					<p>"Gamepoints.com represents an important new paradigm in how users can earn and redeem virtual currency," said Sumit Gupta of BitRhymes, developers of the popular social games Tag Me, Wild Paradise and many others. "It gives our players a much larger variety of proven and unique ways to earn credit than the current in-game transactional model, as well as a seamless process for redeeming those credits for our own game currency.  This model allows more of our users to engage more deeply in our games by giving them a place where they can earn credits without interrupting their game play."</p>

					<p>While GamePoints.com is in beta, the site's virtual currency can be redeemed in approximately 100 applications on Facebook, including 8 of the top 10 games as ranked by AppData. Soon users will be able to spend Game Points in hundreds of other social games, virtual worlds and MMOs across multiple platforms and the open web. Offerpal will also be integrating new alternative payment options into the site in the near future. </p>
