					  <h1>More than Half of Social Gamers Willing to Complete a Marketing Action to Earn Virtual Currency,
According to Study for Offerpal Media by comScore</h1>
                <br />
        <em>March 10, 2010 </em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>Company data also shows strong incremental lift from new alternative payment methods </i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>San Francisco    </strong>-<strong> March 10, 2010    </strong> -                While most game developers struggle to monetize even three  percent of their users through direct payments for virtual currency, new  numbers released today by Offerpal Media (<a href="https://mex07a.mailtrust.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=e9c15c9bb1b84d57958198495cbf2ecb&amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.offerpalmedia.com" target="_blank">http://www.offerpalmedia.com</a>) at the Game Developers Conference show that alternative  payment methods enable developers to monetize significantly larger portions of  their user base. Derived from a study conducted by comScore, a leader in  measuring the digital world, as well as from Offerpal's own network-wide monetization  performance, the numbers verify that social gamers are enthusiastic about  alternative, or indirect, payment methods as a way to earn virtual currency for  free rather than having to pay for it directly. <strong> </strong>
                <p>According to the comScore  study, 53.3% of the total respondents reported that they would be &ldquo;very likely&rdquo;  to complete a marketing action such as filling out a survey, watching a video,  shopping at online retailers or signing up for a subscription in order to get  points for the games they play on leading social networks. By comparison, only  22.8% of the respondents reported that they would be willing and are able to buy  the points using cash payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, bank  transfers or mobile billing.</p>
                <p>The study found  that 29.7% of social gamers do not have the ability or the means to pay for  virtual currency with cash options, and even among those who do have the  ability and the means, 34.9% say they are &ldquo;very unlikely&rdquo; to part with their  money in order to purchase points. When asked to indicate how likely they would  be to use indirect payment methods to earn points in the games they play, the  top preferred marketing actions included, in order, completing a free survey,  watching a video, completing tasks such as tagging a photo or proofreading a  document, shopping for clothes or other goods online, subscribing to a magazine  and subscribing to a movie rental program. </p>
                <p>Consumers' preference for alternative means to pay for  virtual currency has been borne out in Offerpal's own metrics as well.&nbsp; In recent months, the company has added to  its monetization platform a number of alternative payment options, including  surveys, shopping rewards, tasks and video, to go along with the offers it has  always run. Offerpal reports that since September, 2009-when it launched  Offerpal SURVEYS, the first of these incremental alternative payment  options-the company has seen a 20% increase in the percent of users it is able  to monetize. </p>
                <p>One example of this growth is seen in recent tests of the  company's video campaigns, in which 75% of the consumers who viewed a video ad  in exchange for virtual currency had never before completed any type of offer  nor made a direct payment. What's more, nearly 10% of those users went on to  complete at least one or more transactions-often incremental cash purchases-in just  the first week after watching a video. Similarly, of the users whose first  &ldquo;payment&rdquo; of virtual currency was by earning it through Offerpal's shopping  rewards program, 21% went on to make a second transaction through the Offerpal  system within one week.&nbsp; </p>
                <p>&ldquo;The data we're  seeing shows that there is clearly a strong demand within social gaming for  alternative ways to pay for virtual currency,&rdquo; said George Garrick, CEO of  Offerpal Media. &ldquo;When you think of how easy it is to conduct some of these  marketing actions like watching a video ad, and the fact that so many people are  already doing them online frequently and for no compensation, it makes complete  sense that they might as well get rewarded in virtual currency for it. Our goal  is to leverage all the most popular alt-pay methods to monetize the maximum  number of users at the highest Revenue Per User for our developer partners.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>Other findings from  the report include: </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Gamers       in the 25-34 age range are most likely (70.9 % &ldquo;very likely&rdquo;) to be       willing to earn virtual currency through marketing actions; </li>
                  <li>Most       of the gamers (54.5%) report playing games online at least once a day;       26.7% reported playing several times a week; 11.5% play about once a week;       and 7.3% play two to three times a month; </li>
                  <li>When       asked what kinds of games they play on a regular basis, 58.4% of the respondents       said they regularly play virtual world/simulation games, followed by       arcade games (40.3%), role playing games (33.5%), action games (29.7%),       board games (26.9%), card games (25.6%) and word games (23.4%); </li>
                  <li>Of       those who say they are &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to buy points with a cash payment       method, a majority of the users are men (53.4%) and a plurality in the       25-34 age range (42.8%); 85.4% of the users who say they are &ldquo;very likely&rdquo;       to buy points with cash are also &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; to earn points through       marketing actions.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>George Garrick will  share findings from the release during Offerpal's hosted forum at the Game  Developers Conference called &ldquo;Social and Mobile Gaming: What's Next?&rdquo;, to be  held Friday, March 12th, 2010, at 3:00 pm in Moscone Center's South  Hall, Room 310.

                <p>The study was  conducted between February 12th and February 15th, 2010,  and includes detailed responses from 799 comScore panelists. Respondents were  filtered to only include users who play games on the leading social network at  least once a month.<br />
