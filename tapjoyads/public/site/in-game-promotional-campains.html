					 <h1><strong>Offerpal Media Helps Game Developers Triple Offer-Based Revenue With In-Game Promotional Campaigns</strong></h1>
			      <p><br/>
		            <em>New white paper shares best practices in virtual currency monetization  </em><br /><br />
		            <strong>Fremont, CA - June 17, 2010 </strong> -
			    Offerpal  Media (<a href="http://www.offerpalmedia.com">http://www.offerpalmedia.com</a>),  the leader in virtual currency payment alternatives, published a white paper today on best practices to help game developers and social publishers monetize their virtual currencies through in-game promotional offers and alternative payments. Titled "Beyond the Offerwall: Monetizing virtual currency through in-game promotions," the white paper reveals actual data from in-game promotions the company conducted with several of its top publishing partners in May, 2010.
			    </p>
					<p>The paper is available for download at <a href="http://offerpalmedia.com/white-papers.php">http://offerpalmedia.com/white-papers.php</a>.

			      </p>
					<p>
						Key findings include:
					</p>
				<ul>
                  <li>Participating developers experienced a more than 3x increase in offer-based advertising revenue versus normal daily revenue </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>93% of the users who completed ad offers through the in-game promotions were new users who had never taken part in an offer in that game before </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Within the first week after completing an in-game promotional offer, over 10% of these newly monetized users had returned to fill out another offer or make a direct payment </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>The effective CPM rate was $2.03, compared to typical CPM rates in the range of $0.10 to $1.00.  </li>
                </ul>


				<p>
				"Traditional 'offerwalls' remain the most effective foundation for developers to monetize their virtual currency, but only about 10% of a game's audience tends to find them," said Mihir Shah, Chief Revenue Officer of Offerpal Media.  "In-game promotional campaigns allow our game developers to reach a broader audience, do much more interesting user and demographic targeting, and get best-in-industry payouts based on higher volumes and contextual relevance from major advertisers.  We uniquely understand that this is a direct response business first and foremost, not only a payments business."
				</p>

				<p>
					An "in-game promotion," as used in the paper, refers to any advertising offer that is presented in certain junctions of a game that allow it to engage with users on a deeper level or to reach more users than a traditional "offerwall." Examples of in-game promotions include promotional display banners, special notifications, in-game flash integrations, branded virtual goods and more.
