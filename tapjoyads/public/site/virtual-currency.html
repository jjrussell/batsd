                    <i>Flexible, robust analytics tool gives social publishers the insight needed to effectively monetize their virtual economy


</i>
                    <p>
     <strong>Fremont, CA - June 18, 2009  - </strong> Offerpal Media, the leader in monetization solutions for social networks and applications, online games, virtual worlds, mobile apps and other social publishers, today announced the launch of its Virtual Currency Analytics package, designed to provide valuable insights that help maximize publisher revenues while optimizing the user experience. Combining a simple, flexible interface with robust reporting features, Offerpal Media's analytics package enables social publishers to track the activity and monetization performance of their users based on any attribute they choose - such as User Level, Character Type, Install Source, Account Age, Basic Demographics and others - by passing a few parameters to Offerpal Media through the company's simple I-Frame integration. This powerful tool is now available for free to any publisher using Offerpal Media's &quot;Managed Offer Platform&quot; for monetization.  </p>

                    <p>&quot;Our analytics package is like  nothing else on the market,&quot; said Anu Shukla, Founder &amp; CEO of  Offerpal Media. &quot;In building this tool, we worked closely with top social  publishers to understand their needs, and from that we developed a powerful  tool to help them slice and dice the data any way they'd like so they can better  understand what's working within their economy and what areas need improvement.&quot; </p>
                    <p>With  Offerpal Media's Virtual Currency Analytics, social publishers can track the monetization  performance of up to seven different attributes per application, with up to  1,000 different parameters per attribute. The reports provide detailed  analysis&nbsp;for&nbsp;each attribute, allowing publishers to home in on one or  more key metrics at a time, including Revenue, Impressions, Unique Visitors,  Offer Clicks, Offer Completions, eCPM, Click Through Rate, Conversion Rate,  Revenue per Click or Earnings per Click. Two types of graphs are available-an  Attribute Graph for charting the performance of any single attribute, and a  Trend Graph for charting the performance over time. </p>
                    <p>This deep  level of visibility into their virtual economies allows publishers to gain key  insights into the dials and levers that have the biggest impact on their  virtual economy. For instance, they can understand which user groups monetize  the best, at what point users begin engaging with their virtual economy, or  which game dynamics bring in the most revenue. </p>
                    <p>One of the  beta testers of Offerpal Media's Virtual Currency Analytics package was  Sibblingz, Inc., the developers behind the popular Make a Baby application on Facebook  and MySpace. </p>
                    <p>&quot;Offerpal  Media continues to be an innovative partner, developing products that not only  help drive our monetization efforts, but assist in heightening the social  experience for our users, &quot; said Rohit Dewan, Director of Engineering at  Sibblingz, Inc. &quot;Offerpal's Virtual Currency Analytics tool has enabled us to  get a better understanding of how our audience monetizes based on attributes  such as the Age Level of their virtual babies, how many Growth points they've  earned, and other key data points.&quot; </p>
                    <p>Configuring  the package is quick and easy and can be conducted in less than ten minutes, allowing social app developers  and site publishers to start tracking  their monetization performance immediately. Cross-platform integration enables publishers to analyze their virtual  economies across all social networks and destination Web sites from one central  location. Developers and publishers interested in learning more about  Offerpal Media's Virtual Currency Analytics can email publishersupport@offerpal.com  or call 510.257.5600.
