					    <h1>Offerpal Media Partners with Tapjoy to Drive New Revenue Streams for iPhone Application Developers  </h1>
                <br />
          <em>June 25, 2009</em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>Joint solution monetizes and grows userbase for iPhone applications through virtual goods and rewarded installs </i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, CA - June 25, 2009 - </strong><a href="http://www.offerpalmedia.com/"> Offerpal Media</a> the leading monetization platform for social networks, online games, virtual worlds and mobile applications, today announced a partnership with Tapjoy, developers of the public Tapjoy SDK, to provide iPhone application developers with new solutions to help them monetize their applications through the sale of virtual goods. The joint solution, is available today as part of Tapjoy&rsquo;s comprehensive Software Development Kit, a package of services built to help mobile app developers improve their apps and make them more profitable. The SDK can be downloaded for free in parts or its entirety at <a href="http://www.tapjoy.com">www.tapjoy.com</a><br />
                    <br />
                    While Offerpal Media has been operating on the iPhone since January this year, the partnership with Tapjoy further extends the company&rsquo;s reach to all Tapjoy-enabled applications. Tapjoy&rsquo;s SDK also makes it easier than ever for iPhone app developers to integrate Offerpal&rsquo;s &quot;Managed Offer Platform&quot; as a native part of the user experience. A key feature of the joint solution is the ability for developers to grow their apps quickly through rewarded installs of active, engaged mobile gamers across the Tapjoy network of millions of users.
        <br />
                    <br />
                   &quot;Until recently, mobile app developers have been at a disadvantage in terms of options to monetize their user base,&quot; said Anu Shukla, CEO and Founder of Offerpal Media. &quot;Developers have told us they need more options to monetize, and the joint Offerpal and Tapjoy solution will help many iPhone app developers make the leap to profitability more quickly and easily.&quot;<br />
                   <br />





                    Tapjoy, also the developers of top-ranked iPhone apps such as TapDefense, TapSudoku and TapWord, used their key learnings from building their own apps to create the Tapjoy SDK.  On top of the Offerpal virtual goods monetization and rewarded installs solutions, other services in the SDK include mobile ad network optimization, full app analytics, wagered tournaments, challenges between users, customizable rankings and leaderboards.
                  <br /><br />
                    &quot;Offerpal Media is the largest virtual currency monetization solution, and we are delighted to be working with them,&quot; said Lee Linden, Co-founder of Tapjoy. &quot;This partnership is an exciting endeavor for us and reaffirms our commitment to delivering the most effective and reliable services to the mobile app development community.&quot;<br />
