					  <h1>Offerpal Media Publishes Advertising Policies for Virtual Currency Offers, Develops Tools and Processes to Ensure Compliance

</h1>
                <br />
          <em>November 19, 2009</em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>New standards established to protect the user experience on social games and applications</i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, Calif.   </strong>-<strong> November 19, 2009   </strong> -
                Offerpal Media, the leader in  virtual currency monetization, today published a set of <a href="http://offerpalmedia.com/advertising-policies.php">advertising policies</a> on its web site and unveiled details on its efforts to create a better user  experience for consumers who complete advertising offers in exchange for  virtual currency on popular online games and social networks. The new advertising  policies forbid any offers that are misleading, deceptive or otherwise  objectionable, while defining clear guidelines and principles for the language  and creative of all offers distributed through the Offerpal platform.
                <p>&ldquo;The direct marketing industry, in  all channels, is plagued by unscrupulous marketers, but the rapid growth and  popularity of virtual currency offers has spotlighted the problem in social  media,&rdquo; said George Garrick, CEO of Offerpal Media. &ldquo;As the leader in the  space, Offerpal is in the fortunate position of having more resources than any  of our competitors, and we are investing these resources to build out  technologies and compliance systems to help take the industry to the highest  possible standard of quality and integrity.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>While the new policies serve as a  minimum standard for compliance, Offerpal's platform offers publishing partners  the flexibility to custom define their environments based on their specific  needs and compliance requirements. Offerpal will rate all offers by quality and  allow its partners to select a quality level of compliance ranging from &ldquo;Level  1&rdquo; for minimal restrictions to &ldquo;Level 5&rdquo; for highly conservative restrictions. </p>
                <p>Other efforts the company is taking  to elevate the standards for the industry include: </p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Creating       a &ldquo;Compliance Server,&rdquo; which will serve as a 24x7 electronic watchdog to       look for any unapproved deviations to an advertiser's landing pages in       order to ensure that any violations are caught and removed within five       minutes;</li>
                  <li>Upgrading       our Customer Support facilities by adding more representatives and better       tools to ensure that every ticket is processed within 48 hours;</li>
                  <li>Partnering       with well-known industry associations and other offer provider platforms       to jointly form standards boards and committees that will establish       industry-wide standards and regulations; </li>
                  <li>Refining       the company's multi-step review and approval process to ensure that every       offer it distributes is in complete compliance with the developers and       publishers through whom the offer is distributed; </li>
                  <li>Securing       new &ldquo;high-value&rdquo; offers with compelling discounts, coupons or custom deals       from select advertisers with recognizable brand names. </li>
                </ul>
