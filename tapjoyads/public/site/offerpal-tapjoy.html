                    <br />
                    <i>Transaction strengthens Offerpal's position as the leader in  monetizing and distributing mobile applications
</i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, CA    </strong>-<strong> March 23, 2010   </strong> -                Offerpal  Media (<a href="http://offerpalmedia.com">http://offerpalmedia.com</a>), the leader in virtual currency payment alternatives, today announced it has acquired Tapjoy, creators of the Tapjoy platform for mobile developers and the leading provider of monetization and distribution services on the iPhone, Android and other emerging mobile platforms. The acquisition accelerates Offerpal's expansion into the rapidly growing mobile market by extending the company's virtual currency monetization model to mobile applications.
                <p>The Tapjoy platform includes a turnkey software library that enables  mobile developers to embed fully functional virtual goods storefronts with the  ability to process microtransactions. The library also comes with a built-in Pay-Per-Install  user acquisition program, an ad optimization layer and application analytics. As  part of the agreement, the co-founders of Tapjoy will join Offerpal in  leadership positions to help expand its mobile business. Financial terms of the  acquisition were not disclosed. </p>
                <p>&quot;There are more than 200 million mobile phone users in the U.S. alone,  and most of them will soon have a way to play games on their devices,&quot; said  George Garrick, Chairman and CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;We also expect the  microtransaction model to move beyond games, and for there to be practically  unlimited applications for microtransactions on mobile platforms as well as the  Web. The addition of Tapjoy provides us with a proven product that dovetails  nicely with our own platform strategy and creates tremendous economic  advantages for mobile developers.&quot;</p>
                <p>Offerpal Media's full-service monetization platform is a hosted service empowering  more than 2,000 game developers and social publishers to monetize virtual  currency through alternative payment methods such as offers, surveys, videos, shopping  rewards, tasks and more. The company first announced its mobile program in  January, 2009. Today, mobile-friendly versions of its network offers are  running on top iPhone applications such as Tap Tap Revenge, Tap Farm, Papaya, Mobsters:  Big Apple, and many others. </p>
                <p>The Tapjoy  founders, Lee Linden and Ben Lewis, originally developed top-ranked iPhone applications  such as TapDefense, TapSudoku, TapWord and others. They used key learnings from  building their own bestselling and highly profitable apps to create the Tapjoy  services that now benefit other developers. Currently, more than 1,000 mobile  developers have integrated all or parts of the Tapjoy library, and the  company's annual installs, user base and revenue is expected to quadruple this  year. Tapjoy's reach extends to over 35 million mobile consumers. The Tapjoy library  is the leading virtual goods and virtual currency service on the iPhone and the  only such service available on the Android.</p>
                <p>&quot;The opportunity for innovation in mobile gaming is almost unlimited, but  developers face great challenges when it comes to monetizing and distributing  their applications,&quot; said Lee Linden, Co-founder of Tapjoy. &quot;Our goal is to  help mobile developers improve their applications, grow their user bases and  generate higher revenues, and through this deal with an industry leader like  Offerpal, we can now do all of that more effectively.&quot;</p>
