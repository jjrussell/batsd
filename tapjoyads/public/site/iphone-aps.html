					  <h1>Offerpal Media Launches Monetization Platform for iPhone Applications</h1>
                    <br />
                    <i>January 14, 2009</i>
                    <br /><br />
                    <i>Popular MySpace, Facebook solution continues to extend its reach to new platforms </i>
                    <br /><br />
<strong>Fremont, CA - January 14, 2009  - </strong><a href="http://www.offerpalmedia.com/">Offerpal Media</a>,today announced that its <a href="http://www.offerpal.com/platform.php">Managed Offer Platform</a> is now available for the Apple iPhone, providing platform developers with the first solution to generate significant revenues from their applications. Already the leading monetization solution for applications on  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/index.php?lh=26e62db1d856724127fadb54d426ab40&amp;">Facebook</a>,<a href="http://www.myspace.com/">MySpace</a>,                  <a href="http://www.bebo.com/c/site/index">Bebo</a>,<a href="http://hi5.com/">hi5</a>,and dozens  of other social networks as well as social gaming sites and virtual worlds such  as <a href="http://www.weeworld.com/">WeeWorld</a>,<a href="http://www.aeriagames.com/">Aeria Games</a>,and <a href="http://www.acclaim.com/">Acclaim Games</a>,Offerpal  Media has helped hundreds of its publishing partners earn eCPM rates in the  hundreds of dollars. Now, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> application developers can similarly monetize and engage their users.  <br />
                    <br />

                    "We view the iPhone as the next big application platform,&quot; said Anu Shukla, Founder & CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;At last count there were more than 10,000 iPhone applications, most of which are free or extremely low cost to use and have yet to provide developers with any significant revenues. Offerpal Media gives iPhone developers a simple yet successful way to generate incredible revenues."
                    <br /><br />
                    Offerpal Media's platform monetizes developer traffic by enabling iPhone users to earn points or other types of virtual currencies in exchange for taking part in scientifically targeted and relevant advertising offers such as free trials, online surveys, big-brand discounts and more. The virtual currencies are then redeemed by purchasing virtual goods or services from the developers.
                  <br />
                    <br />
                    Offerpal Media's &quot;Managed Offer Platform&quot; is a full-service, turnkey advertising solution that can be embedded into any iPhone application simply by inserting a snippet of code. The platform comes complete with: <br />
<br />

					<ul>
					 <li><strong>2,000+ advertising offers</strong> - dynamically rotated for targeting and relevancy</li>
					<li><strong>Real-time optimization </strong> - to maximize publisher revenues and ensure high lead quality</li>
					<li><strong>Customer support </strong> - available 24/7 to handle users' questions and issues</li>
					<li><strong>Web-based reporting </strong> - allowing publishers to track their revenues and activities in real-time </li>
					<li><strong>Account management </strong> - personalized service to help optimize revenues from every angle</li>

					</ul>



Offerpal Media is currently accepting submissions from iPhone application developers who are interested in participating in the company's iPhone beta program. Developers on other platforms have generated a network-wide average of $75 per day for every 1,000 Daily Active Users to their application - with eCPMs in the range of $150 - 200, often higher - and initial tests show that iPhone developers can expect to earn at least as much. To join the program, developers should contact Offerpal Media directly by emailing
