					     <h1>Offerpal Media Launches Multivariate Testing Platform for Online Game Developers</h1>
                <br />
          <em>September 16, 2009</em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>Self-service solution enables developers to increase revenues by testing and optimizing virtual economy  variables</i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, CA </strong>-<strong> September 16, 2009 </strong> - Offerpal Media, the leader in virtual currency monetization, today announced the launch of its self-service Multivariate Testing platform. Designed to help online game developers increase revenues from their virtual goods and services, the platform provides a simple way to test, measure and optimize critical monetization variables including exchange rates, price points, user interface options and more. The multivariate testing is available for free to users of Offerpal Media&rsquo;s virtual currency payment platform.
                <p>The initial version of the product  allows developers to test their exchange rate, or rate at which real dollars convert  to virtual currencies. Given the number of variables that go into determining  the optimum exchange rate, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to identify  through simple trial and error. Prior experience shows that an exchange rate  that is too low, for instance, might not create enough perceived value, while  an overly high exchange rate could lead to an inflated economy. Offerpal's testing  platform provides a scientific framework for testing variations in a  developer's exchange rate and optimizing the results accordingly. </p>
                <p>&ldquo;Finding the right exchange  rate is one of the most crucial factors in monetizing our games,&rdquo; said Markus Weichselbaum,  CEO of TheBroth, developers behind popular Facebook games Barn Buddy, Kickmania  and PuzzleBee. &ldquo;Offerpal's Multivariate Testing platform takes the guesswork  out of exchange rate testing by allowing us to pinpoint the exact rate that generates  the highest Revenue Per User without inflating the economy. We commend Offerpal  for delivering yet another invaluable resource to help developers make more  money.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>Subsequent versions of Offerpal's  Multivariate Testing platform will include features that let developers test  critical elements including: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>User interface options&mdash;such as background colors and font  choices&mdash;to discover which combination encourages the most clicks and  conversions</li>
                  <li>Different prices points for virtual goods and services, to understand  which pricing strategy monetizes best</li>
                  <li>The offer mix, measuring the monetization impact of including  or excluding certain advertising offers or categories of offers</li>
                  <li>Which tab within the Offerpal I-Frame (&ldquo;All&rdquo; offers, &ldquo;Free&rdquo; offers,  &ldquo;Mobile&rdquo; offers, &ldquo;Survey&rdquo; offers, etc.) generates the best performance when set  to the default tab. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>&ldquo;Based on our experience  having issued more than 30 billion virtual points, one of the clear needs we  identified for our partners is helping them establish an effective exchange  rate,&rdquo; said Anu Shukla, Founder &amp; CEO of Offerpal Media. &ldquo;This new product  is designed to help developers easily identify the ideal exchange rate that monetizes  effectively while delivering an optimum user experience.&rdquo;</p>
