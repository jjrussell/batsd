                    <br /><br />
     <strong>Fremont, CA - June 9, 2009  - </strong> <a href="http://www.offerpalmedia.com/">Offerpal Media</a>, the leader in advertising and monetization on social networks and applications, online games, virtual worlds, mobile apps and other online communities, today announced a partnership with <a href="http://www.imvu.com/">IMVU</a>, an  <a href="http://www.imvu.com/signup/index.php">avatar-based</a> social network and virtual world with more than 35 million registered users and 5 million unique visitors per month. The two companies are working together to allow IMVU users to earn free digital credits for participating in any of Offerpal's 2,500+ scientifically targeted and relevant  <a href="http://www.offerpal.com/advertisers.php">advertising offers</a>, including free trials, big-brand discounts, online surveys and more.<br />
                    <br />
&quot;We implemented Offerpal to further monetize our user base,&quot; said Kevin Dasch, IMVU's vice president of finance and business development. &quot;This platform provides yet another way for our loyal members to obtain IMVU credits, our virtual currency.&quot;<br />
                    <br />

Offerpal Media's


                  <a href="http://www.offerpal.com/platform.php">platform</a> monetizes social traffic by enabling users to earn points or other types of virtual currencies in exchange for taking part in advertising offers. The virtual currencies earned for free can then be redeemed for in-game goods and services, thereby enriching the social experience and deepening user engagement. Offerpal has already helped hundreds of its publishing partners earn an average of $75 per day for every 1,000 Daily Active Users to their application - with eCPMs in the range of $150 - 200, often higher. In turn, advertisers are able to tap into Offerpal Media's expansive network of 50 million active and engaged social networking users.<br />
                <br />
