                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, Calif.    </strong>-<strong> April 8, 2010   </strong> - Offerpal  Media (<a href="http://offerpalmedia.com">http://offerpalmedia.com</a>),the leader in virtual currency payment alternatives, announced today that it recently integrated several new direct payment options into its platform in order to help social developers and online game publishers accept payments from users who do not have or are unwilling to use credit cards. The new payment options include pre-paid debit cards, phone cards, e-payment systems, parent-approved payments and more, from such partners as Zeus Research and STi Prepaid, paysafecard, MyCard, Rixty, BillMyParents, ClickandBuy and others-covering nearly 200 countries in all.
                <p>The company also announced it recently hired payment industry veteran Alex Brutin as its Vice President of Business Development. Mr. Brutin is responsible for forging new relationships with other direct payment providers and monetization partners as well as new strategic initiatives.

                <p>&quot;Our vision is to help developers monetize larger portions of their user bases, whether through alternative payment options like offers, videos and surveys, or cash payment methods such as credit cards and all their substitutes,&quot; said George Garrick, Chairman and CEO of Offerpal Media. &quot;There's a lot of innovation in the online payment space at the moment, with all sorts of new payment products that enable developers to monetize distinct sets of users based on geography, demographics and behavior types. We're proud to bring on board someone like Alex to help us identify the most appropriate partners to work with and build up profitable relationships.&quot; </p>
