</h1>
                <br />
          <em>October 29, 2009</em><br />
                    <br />
                    <i>More than 2,000 publishers count on Offerpal's virtual currency payment platform to monetize online games, virtual worlds, social networks and subscription services</i>
                    <br /><br />
                <strong>Fremont, Calif.   </strong>-<strong> October 29, 2009   </strong> - Offerpal Media, the leader in virtual currency monetization, today marked its two-year anniversary by announcing the company has surpassed 160 million users and has issued more than 730 million virtual points globally. As one of the pioneers helping drive the $6 billion virtual goods economy, Offerpal's turnkey payment platform gives consumers the opportunity to earn or buy virtual currency by completing targeted advertising offers or by purchasing it through direct, global payment options. The company powers millions of transactions every month, with payment options in 190 countries and offers in more than 80 countries.
                <p>When Offerpal launched in October 2007 on the Facebook application (fluff) friends, it became the gaming industry's first offer-based monetization platform. Since then, Offerpal's network has grown to more than 2,000 publishers around the world who rely on the company's full-service platform to monetize their virtual currency. Offerpal's scope of services relieves developers from having to manage multiple payment providers, customer service, ad inventory, optimization and testing, freeing them up to focus on what they do best: designing and managing their games or web sites.  </p>
                <p>&ldquo;When I first integrated Offerpal's platform into  (fluff) friends, I knew it would work, I just didn't know how well,&rdquo; said Mike  Sego, founder of (fluff) friends, which was since acquired by SGN. &ldquo;Offerpal  helped me realize that I had a legitimate business model behind the application  and could generate a lot of revenue. Obviously, they've helped a lot of other  developers do the same.&rdquo; </p>
                <p>Offerpal expects to roll out more enhancements to its platform throughout 2010.</p>
                <h2 align="left">Milestones Since Launch</h2>
